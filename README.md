### Cash Receipts PTLS Upload
#### Project 1

For each customer that sends a remittance advice that is or can be in excel (xls) format, a data import
template should be created using the Customer Code as the Template Name
For Freight Payment companies that pay multiple McLeod customers - will need each Customer Code
before import can be completed

User creates import template that fits the remittance advice exactly (no change to excel remittance
advice and no change to import template) and that file is imported into McLeod system.
